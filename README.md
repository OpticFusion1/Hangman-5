# Hangman
This is a text-based game written in Java that copies the popular game: Hangman

The program will randomly select from a list of 40 words.
The word will be what the user has to guess.

User may guess one letter at a time.
The display will update and show what letters are correct.

The code is messy and some areas may seem redundant.
I began this to grasp an understanding of how Java file I/O works and how to read from a text file.

Perhaps I will revisit this in the future and implement more common features of Hangman

### Future Implementations
- Timer
- Give users a limited number of guesses
- Play with GUI / visuals
- Display list of letters already guessed
